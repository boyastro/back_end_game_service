# Chess AI Bot Implementation

This document explains the implementation of the AI chess bot for the WebSocket chess game.

## Overview

The AI chess bot allows players to play a game of chess when there is no human opponent available. The implementation consists of the following components:

1. **Chess AI Logic**: A module that generates moves for the AI player based on the current board state.
2. **Integration with Game Flow**: Modifications to the existing WebSocket handlers to support playing against the AI.

## Files Modified

1. `src/utils/chess-ai-bot.ts` - New file containing the AI chess move generation logic
2. `src/controllers/aws-chess-ws-handler.ts` - Modified to integrate AI bot functionality

## How It Works

### Chess AI Bot Logic

The AI bot uses a simple strategy for generating moves:

1. Analyzes the current board to find all valid moves for the AI's pieces
2. Prioritizes capture moves (taking opponent's pieces)
3. Falls back to random valid moves if no captures are available

The implementation includes support for all chess piece types (pawns, rooks, knights, bishops, queens, kings) and their respective movement patterns.

### Game Flow with AI

1. **Game Initialization**:

   - When a single player joins a room, the game starts with AI as the opponent
   - The player receives a notification that they're playing against AI

2. **Move Processing**:

   - After a human player makes a move, if there's no second human player, the AI automatically makes a counter-move
   - The AI move is processed in the same way as a human move and broadcasted to the human player

3. **Special Cases**:
   - The AI supports pawn promotion, automatically promoting to a queen or other pieces
   - Game ending conditions (checkmate, stalemate) are handled the same way as in human vs. human games

## Future Improvements

The current AI implementation uses a simple strategy. Future improvements could include:

1. Adding different difficulty levels
2. Implementing a more sophisticated chess engine (minimax with alpha-beta pruning)
3. Adding opening book knowledge
4. Implementing position evaluation based on piece values and position

## Client-Side Integration

The client-side needs to:

1. Display an indicator when playing against the AI
2. Handle the `isAIMove` flag in move messages to potentially display differently
3. The `withAI: true` property in the gameStarted message indicates an AI opponent

## Testing

To test the AI functionality:

1. Connect to the game with a single player
2. The game should automatically start after a brief delay
3. Make a move as the human player
4. The AI should respond with its own move
